## Table of Contents

<!--[in accordance with the original book proposal, future revisions of this text will add feature Part 0/Preface: History of Surveillance Abuses and possibly Part III: expanded Countermeasures]-->

This open textbook can be read in linear fashion -- cryptography fundamentals followed by their application in threats to social movement groups and available countermeasures.  Alternative reading sequences can be made available as "playlists", and will be done in future revisions to the text (e.g. the order presented in-class in CS175 at OSU; suggested sequences for social movement groups or digital security trainers).

<!--comments-->

<!--to-do: hooks for inserting theme-specific social-movement/suppression history, i.e. highlight where CS 175 uses black liberation struggles as a focus, and where other social struggles, based on available expertise or course-specific interest could be incorporated -->
