This open textbook supports CS175: Communications Security & Social Movements at Oregon State University.  Since CS175 is an introductory class, this book is accessible to any curious person who wants to learn more about how to protect social movements.  This book can be read linearly, or you can pick and choose what you would like to learn about.  Each chapter is prefaced with what chapters you should read first (for background) and concludes with what you might want to read next.
