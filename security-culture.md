### Security culture -- the basis of digital security 

Before taking specific digital security measures, consider what information needs to be stored or shared and whether it should exist in a digital format.  Keep in mind that any digital information is extremely easy to copy, and so even very strong encryption can only protect information to the extent that every human with access to it can be trusted.  Not even a perfectly designed secure app or digital platform can stop information from being compromised by an infiltrator or defector within a group.

Social movements aware of the history of informant-driven suppression by state and private adversaries have worked to developed what is termed "Security Culture".  This term refers to information sharing agreements and other group practices intended to minimize the negative impacts of infiltration, surveillance, and other suppressive threats to the group, its work, its membership, and broader social movements.  The term "Culture" indicates an aspiration for security principles and practices to become reflexive and intuitive.  The ideal  security culture helps a group to safely and easily communicate and bring in new members, while avoiding excessive paranoia or cumbersome procedures and policies.

Although perspepctives and practices on security culture vary widely, some important widespread principles are: (1) share information on a need-to-know basis; (2) people organizing together should get to know each other as well as possible; (3) avoid discussing details of past actions and never spread rumors.  Let's explore some of these elements in detail.

#### Need-to-know: minimize information sharing

The first principle of keeping secrets is to minimize the number of people who must be trusted to keep them.  Of course there is a spectrum of information sensitivity, from public announcements to open meetings, from in-development press releases to specific places and times of direct actions.  Deciding what information needs to be protected and being careful to protect it is only part of the picture; people also need to accept that they won't have access to sensitive information unless they need it to do their work.

Limiting the amount and extent of information sharing dovetails with good digital security practices in that no platform or means of communication can be considered perfectly secure.  The following chapters cover this in more detail [[devices.md]].

#### Vetting and trust building

Build trust over time.

#### Gossip

Authenticity of information.

#### Avoic oversharing on social media platforms

Social media platforms should only be used to publicly distribute information, and conversations there should never be considered private.

### Tiers of security?

### Limits of technology -- endpoint security [move to devices.md]

* Closed source:
    ** hardware
    ** firmware
    ** microcode
    ** drivers
* Compiler bugs
* Zero days

### What you can do

* from CLDC posts
* limit how much you post online, consider your privacy settings and geolocation settings (but understand that the policies of the companies that hold your data can change)
* Meet in person to share crucial/high-risk info
* Use obfuscation in addition to encryption for crucial/high-risk info that must be shared online


### What does this protect me from? 

* social media monitoring
* subpoenas and search warrants
* doxxing
